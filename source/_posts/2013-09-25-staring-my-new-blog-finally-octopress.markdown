## Finally Octopress !!

Since long time I was waiting to start my blog. Due to time constraints any many other reasons, I couldn't set it up. I've evaluated different blogging platforms and almost decided to use wordpress. Then I found some article about Octopress from my daily reading list. The article was describing about setting up and running an Octopress blog and it finally changed my mind –– from using Wordpress –– to Octopress finally.

### Why Octopress and not Wordpress ?

It's simple and comes up with a neat, elegant ( and responsive ) theme. Wordpress and really the most powerful and most widely used blogging software. It has lot of extentions and plugins available. But for me , for writing some tech tips , don't need all those stuff. Using Octopress , I can use familiar git commands , write everything in markdown and finally can deploy to github itself.

Another thing I liked is that , all my blog content will be residing in my system itself in the form of markdown files. I can generate my static blog site anytime I need and deploy to number of services. Wordpress infact saves all the contents to it's database. So obviously Octopress blog will be faster because it's all static html pages compared to dynamic blog like wordpress –– as it need to fetch from database everytime.

### How to set up an Octopress blog ?

This has been covered in different articles. I don't want to put the same here – instead here is the link to some of them.
