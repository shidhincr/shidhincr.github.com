## What is this all about ?

Being a good customer of Packet Pub from long time, I did subscribe to their email service, so that I would be notified about the latest book releases, promotional offers..etc. And today, I received an email about their 2000th title offer. I guess this is an exciting offer worth sharing through my blog.

This was the content of the mail:

>We, at Packt Publishing are launching an exciting campaign to coincide with the release of our 2000th title. During this offer Packt is giving its reader a chance to dive into their comprehensive catalogue and avail a Buy One, Get One Free offer across their entire range of eBooks.
