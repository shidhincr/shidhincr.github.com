I wanted to start writing blog ever since I started coding. I never had a success setting it up because of time constraints and many other reasons. During this time, I've evaluated a number of blogging platforms and eventually I thought of using wordpress as my blogging platform when I start my blog.

Now finally I'm having some time. I decided to spend some time everyday dedicating to my blog. So first thing I need to do is setting up a wordpress blog with default template. 

I started browsing to find a good theme for the wordpress blog before setting up anything. While browsing, I opened **[paulirish.com](http://www.paulirish.com)** and saw that he'd recently switched his blog to some new blogging software called Octopress. 
I also read about Octopress from my daily reading list, but didn't give much attention to it. But I found Paul's blog very neat –– The default theme of Octopress is awesome –– and it's responsive too. I started checking out all Octopress blogs, and how to configure it. Finally I decided to use Octopress for my blog.

### Why Octopress and not Wordpress ?

Octopress is simple and comes up with a neat, elegant ( and responsive ) theme. Obviously Wordpress is really the most powerful and most widely used blogging software, and it has lot of extentions and plugins available. But for me , for writing some tech tips , don't need all those stuff. Using Octopress , I can use familiar git commands , write everything in markdown and finally can deploy to github pages.

Another thing I liked is, all my blog content will be residing in my system itself in the form of markdown files. I can generate my static blog site anytime I need and deploy to number of hosting services. The advantage of a static website over a dynamic platform like Wordpress is : It's loading time will be faster. Because everytime I access a blog post in Wordpress, it need to fetch from the database. But Octopress blog will have only static html pages –– so it will be loaded faster.

### How to set up an Octopress blog ?

This had been covered in many articles. Just google around , you can find a lot. I followed these simple instructions given in the Octopress website. Link is given below

[http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/)

There're couple of good themes built for Octopress ( It's all 3rd party ). Since I like the default Octopress theme, I didn't try any 3rd party themes. But It's worth checking out those.

PS: I'll be writing mainly about Javascript , HTML ,CSS and client side framework and design patterns here. Expect more posts from me soon in this space.
